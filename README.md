# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Description
This project explores and visualizes global COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights across selected countries. 
It analyzes case growth, deaths, vaccination rates over the years, comparing different countries using charts and tables.

## Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 trends in different countries
- Visualize data using bar chart, line charts and pie charts
- Identify gaps and and anomalies in reporting
- Compare total and new cases, deaths and vaccination progress

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas - Data cleaning and manipulation
- Matplotlip and Seaborn - Data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file in JupyterLab, VS Code or Google Colab
3. Run all cells sequentially to load data, process it and generate visualizations
4. Load live CSV data from URLs.

### Optionally install required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Key Insights and Reflection
- Kenya faces challenges in vaccination despite the rising cases.
- India shows rapid vaccination uptake.
- United States leads in total cases and deaths, and also has one of the highest vaccination rates.
